# Internal Development Tooling Strategy

## Overview

Strategic framework for internal tooling that enhances development productivity, operational efficiency, and team collaboration at OmniGaze.

## Current Tooling Landscape

### Development Environment
- **Documentation**: Transitioning to markdown-first approach
- **Editors**: Considering Obsidian and VS Code for markdown editing
- **Version Control**: Git-based workflows for all documentation

### Communication & Collaboration
- **Current**: Microsoft Teams (customer requirement)
- **Evaluation**: Slack and other alternatives for internal use
- **Meeting Tools**: Automatic transcription system being implemented

### Documentation Management
- **Strategy**: Markdown as single source of truth
- **Storage**: Evaluating Confluence vs SharePoint
- **Generation**: Office document generation from markdown when needed

### Testing Infrastructure
*Automated testing capabilities and gaps*

### Monitoring & Observability
*Internal system monitoring and alerting*

## Strategic Tooling Initiatives

### Developer Experience Enhancement
**Objective**: Maximize developer productivity and reduce friction in development workflows

**Key Areas**:
- Development environment standardization
- Code quality and review automation
- Build and deployment optimization
- Local development tooling improvements

### Operational Excellence Tools
**Objective**: Streamline operations and reduce manual overhead

**Key Areas**:
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) advancement
- Automated deployment and rollback capabilities
- System health monitoring and alerting
- Performance optimization tools

### Collaboration & Knowledge Management
**Objective**: Improve team collaboration and knowledge sharing

**Key Areas**:
