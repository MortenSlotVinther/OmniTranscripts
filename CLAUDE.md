## At Start Up

Always get the system date and time

## Project Overview

The omni-transcripts project is designed to digest and analyze OmniGaze's internal meeting transcripts about company strategy. The goal is to structure ideas and concepts from these transcripts into progressively refined descriptions over time, extracting strategic insights and patterns from the collected discussions.

## About OmniGaze

OmniGaze is an advanced IT Asset Management (ITAM) and Enterprise Architecture (EA) platform that combines automated discovery, comprehensive documentation, and real-time monitoring with AI-driven insights to provide organizations with complete visibility into their IT landscape. The platform helps enterprises manage complex IT environments, ensure compliance, and make data-driven architectural decisions.

**Core Platform Overview:**
OmniGaze serves as a unified solution for IT observability, asset management, and enterprise architecture, offering organizations a comprehensive view of their technology ecosystem from infrastructure to applications to business processes. The platform now features MCP Server functionality, enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically connect and enrich discovered elements and flows, creating an intelligent knowledge graph that spans from hardware and software discovery through applications all the way to business capabilities.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- IT Asset Management and automated discovery
- Enterprise Architecture visualization and management
- Application dependency mapping and analysis
- Real-time IT operations monitoring and alerting
- Compliance management and governance
- Change tracking and configuration management
- Performance optimization and insights
- AI-driven knowledge graph enrichment via MCP Server integration
