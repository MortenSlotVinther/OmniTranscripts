## Slide 2: The $1 Trillion Problem

### **Enterprise AI is Broken**

**Individual Tools Win Battles. Infrastructure Wins Wars.**

- **$500B** spent annually on enterprise software development
- **70%** of enterprise AI projects fail due to integration complexity
- **Developer tools** (Cursor, Lovable) solve 10% of the problem
- **90% remains**: Integration, compliance, observability, governance

**The market needs an enterprise-grade AI platform.**
**Not another code assistant.**

## Slide 4: Traction That Defies Logic

### **€317K Revenue. 2 People. 0 External Capital.**

**Customer Wins:**
- **Stark Group**: Saves €25K/month, multi-country deployment
- **GN Store Nord**: Beat ServiceNow in head-to-head RFP
- **Wrist Ship Supply**: Chose us over Ardoq

**Efficiency Metrics:**
- €158,750 revenue per employee (beats Slack, Dropbox at similar stage)
- €19K/month burn rate (vs. €200K industry standard)
- 48-hour implementation (vs. 6-month standard)

**This isn't potential. This is proof.**

## Slide 4.5: The €18M Engineering Miracle

### **We Built €18M of Software for Less Than €1M**

**The Platform Reality:**
- **400,000+ lines of production C# code**
- **182 developer-years** of effort (industry standard: 10 LOC/day)
- **21 active enterprise installations** running 24/7
- **Zero critical failures** in 2 years

**The Impossible Math:**
```
Traditional Enterprise Development:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
20 developers × 9 years = 180 FTE-years
Cost: €18.2 million
Timeline: 2016-2025

OmniGaze Reality:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2 developers × 3 years = 6 FTE-years
Cost: ~€600,000
Timeline: 2022-2025

Efficiency: 30x
```

**How We Did It:**
1. **Elite talent** - Not 10x developers, 30x developers
2. **Zero waste** - No meetings, no politics, no technical debt
3. **AI acceleration** - Harmonoid engine multiplying productivity
4. **Perfect focus** - Solving one problem exceptionally well

**The Competitive Implication:**
- **Competitors need €18M+ and 9 years to match our foundation**
- **We're adding 100K+ LOC/year with AI acceleration**
- **By the time they catch up, we're a decade ahead**

**This isn't a startup. It's a €18M enterprise platform disguised as a seed company.**
