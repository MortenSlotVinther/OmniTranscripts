# Meeting Transcript Processing Workflow

## Overview

Systematic approach for transforming internal meeting transcripts into structured strategic intelligence across OmniGaze's business domains.

## Processing Pipeline

### Stage 1: Initial Transcript Processing
1. **Transcript Ingestion**: Raw meeting transcripts in various formats
2. **Speaker Identification**: Attribute discussions to specific team members
3. **Topic Segmentation**: Break transcript into discussion themes
4. **Initial Categorization**: Sort content into strategic domains

### Stage 2: Content Analysis & Extraction
1. **Key Concept Identification**: Extract strategic insights and decisions
2. **Action Item Detection**: Identify follow-up tasks and responsibilities
3. **Timeline Association**: Link discussions to project timelines
4. **Priority Assessment**: Evaluate importance and urgency of topics

### Stage 3: Strategic Mapping
1. **Cross-Reference Analysis**: Connect insights across meetings and domains
2. **Theme Evolution Tracking**: Monitor how concepts develop over time
3. **Decision Point Documentation**: Capture rationale and context for decisions
4. **Stakeholder Perspective Mapping**: Track different viewpoints on strategic topics

### Stage 4: Documentation Integration
1. **Strategic Document Updates**: Incorporate insights into relevant markdown files
2. **Roadmap Refinement**: Update platform evolution and feature planning
3. **Knowledge Graph Updates**: Enhance cross-document relationships
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor implementation of discussed initiatives
