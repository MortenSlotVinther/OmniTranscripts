## Document Evolution Process

### 1. Meeting Transcript Input
Internal meeting transcripts are processed to extract strategic insights, decisions, and action items.

### 2. Strategic Analysis
Insights are analyzed for:
- Cross-meeting patterns and themes
- Strategic implications and dependencies
- Decision points and rationale
- Timeline and priority assessment

### 3. Document Integration
Strategic insights are integrated into appropriate domain documents, maintaining:
- Traceability to source meetings
- Cross-reference relationships
- Progressive refinement tracking
- Historical context preservation

### 4. Living Documentation
Documents evolve continuously as strategic discussions progress, ensuring current and actionable intelligence.

## Key Strategic Domains

- **Platform Roadmap**: OmniGaze core product evolution and capability development
- **Internal Tools**: Development productivity and operational efficiency tooling
- **Future Products**: New product ideation and market expansion opportunities
- **Market Intelligence**: Competitive landscape and market opportunity analysis
- **Architecture**: Technical platform architecture and innovation strategy
- **Business Strategy**: Go-to-market, partnerships, and revenue growth initiatives
- **Deliverables**: Standardized customer engagement templates (POC, SOW, PID, ARS, ADD)
- **Processes**: End-to-end business processes including comprehensive Lead-to-Cash workflow

## Usage Guidelines

### For Strategic Planning
Each domain document provides structured intelligence for strategic decision-making and planning activities.

### For Cross-Domain Analysis
The framework enables analysis of strategic initiatives across multiple business domains and their interdependencies.

### For Progress Tracking
Documents capture not only strategic intentions but also progress against stated goals and evolving priorities.

### For Customer Engagements
The deliverables folder provides standardized templates for all customer engagement phases, from POC through full implementation.

### For Operational Excellence
The processes documentation ensures consistent execution of business operations with defined metrics and governance.

## Metadata Framework

Strategic insights are tagged with:
- **Source**: Meeting date, participants, context
- **Domain**: Primary strategic area of impact  
- **Maturity**: Ideation → Planning → Development → Implementation
- **Priority**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Timeline**: Short-term, Medium-term, Long-term
- **Dependencies**: Technical, resource, market constraints

## Continuous Evolution

This repository serves as a living strategic intelligence system, continuously evolving as OmniGaze's strategic discussions progress and business priorities develop.
