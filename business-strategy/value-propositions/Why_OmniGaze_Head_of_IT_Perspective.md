# Why OmniGaze - From a Head of IT Perspective

## The Daily IT Challenge

As IT leaders, we face increasing complexity. Multiple cloud providers, hybrid infrastructure, legacy systems, and shadow IT create blind spots that make effective management challenging. Most organizations struggle with:

- **Limited visibility** - Only seeing 60-70% of actual infrastructure
- **Tool sprawl** - 5-10 monitoring tools that don't integrate
- **Manual processes** - Weeks spent on audits and compliance reports  
- **Resource waste** - 30-40% of IT budget spent on underutilized resources
- **Reactive operations** - Fighting fires instead of preventing them

OmniGaze helps address these challenges through automated discovery and intelligent analysis.

## What OmniGaze Actually Does

### 1. Complete Infrastructure Discovery

![Asset Discovery](ScreenShots/AssetLists.png)
*Automated discovery across Windows, Linux, cloud, and virtualized environments*

OmniGaze automatically discovers and maps your entire IT infrastructure:
- Windows and Linux servers (physical and virtual)
- Cloud resources (Azure)
- SQL Server instances and databases
- Active Directory users and groups
- Network connections and dependencies
- Running applications and services

**Typical discovery results:**
- 20-30% unknown assets identified
- Complete hardware and software inventory
- Real-time status of all systems
- Automatic CMDB population

### 2. SQL Server Optimization

*Identify consolidation opportunities across your SQL Server estate*

Our SQL analysis capabilities help reduce licensing costs:
- Discover all SQL instances (including forgotten ones)
- Identify underutilized servers for consolidation
- CIS benchmark compliance checking
- Performance bottleneck analysis
- License optimization recommendations

**Typical savings:** 30-40% reduction in SQL licensing costs through consolidation

### 3. Cloud Cost Management

*Identify oversized cloud resources and optimization opportunities*

Comprehensive cloud cost analysis:
- Rightsizing recommendations based on actual usage
- Idle resource identification
- Reserved instance optimization
- Cross-subscription cost visibility
- Department and project cost allocation
