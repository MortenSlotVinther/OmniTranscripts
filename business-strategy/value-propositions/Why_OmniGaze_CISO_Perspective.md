# Why OmniGaze - From a CISO Perspective

## A Simple Truth About Modern Security

Every CISO faces the same challenge: proving resilience, not just buying tools. Boards and regulators don't want to hear about your security stack anymore. They want one answer: "Are we secure?"

The honest answer for most organizations? "We think so, but we can't be sure."

Not because security teams aren't talented or tools aren't sophisticated. But because you can't secure what you can't see. And in today's hybrid, multi-cloud, shadow IT world, most organizations can't see 30-40% of their infrastructure.

## The Reality We All Face

**The Numbers Don't Lie:**
- 60%+ of breaches exploit legacy vulnerabilities that should have been patched
- Average enterprise has 30% shadow IT they don't know exists
- Compliance audits take weeks because data is scattered across dozens of tools
- Millions spent on security tools that don't talk to each other

**The Regulatory Pressure:**
- DORA demands operational resilience you can prove
- NIS2 requires comprehensive risk management
- GDPR violations average â‚¬20M in fines
- Board liability is now personal under new regulations

You need continuous assurance, not quarterly reviews. You need demonstrable control, not best efforts.

## OmniGaze: Your Real-Time Security Blueprint

OmniGaze is the fastest, cheapest, and most complete way to reduce security and compliance risk by giving you a real-time digital blueprint where every dependency is mapped, every risk is visible, and nothing is left to chance.

### What We Do Differently

**1. Continuous Discovery - Not Periodic Scans**

![Asset Discovery](ScreenShots/AssetLists.png)
*Complete visibility across Windows, Linux, cloud, and shadow IT*

- Automatically discovers ALL assets - on-premises, cloud, shadow IT
- Identifies vulnerabilities and misconfigurations as they appear
- Maps every dependency so you understand blast radius instantly
- Updates in real-time, not quarterly

**2. Automated Compliance - Not Manual Reports**

![SQL CIS Benchmark](ScreenShots/SQLCISBenchmark.png)
*Automated CIS benchmark compliance checking across all SQL servers*

- Asset inventory for ISO27001, NIS2, GDPR, CIS18, DORA reporting at the click of a button
- Continuous compliance monitoring, not point-in-time snapshots
- Evidence collection automated, not screenshot marathons
- Audit-ready posture maintained daily, not scrambled quarterly
- Windows event logs aggregated and analyzed automatically
- much more

**3. Risk Intelligence - Not Just Alerts**

![Risk Overview](ScreenShots/HighLevelRiskOverview.png)
*Comprehensive risk dashboard showing vulnerabilities, compliance gaps, and security posture*

- AI-driven anomaly detection catches threats before they escalate
- Risk scoring based on YOUR environment, not generic ratings
- Prioritization that matters - focus on the 3% that could hurt you
- Predictive analysis to prevent tomorrow's incidents
- more
