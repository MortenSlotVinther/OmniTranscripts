### Key Architecture Decisions

#### ADR-001: Markdown as Single Source of Truth
- **Decision**: All documentation stored in markdown format
- **Rationale**: Platform-agnostic, version-controllable, AI-friendly
- **Consequences**: Need document generation pipeline for Office formats
- **Status**: Approved

#### ADR-002: Meeting Transcription Architecture
- **Decision**: Automatic transcription for all meetings
- **Components**: Email scanner, transcription service, storage layer
- **Rationale**: Capture institutional knowledge, improve searchability
- **Status**: In Implementation

#### ADR-003: Customer Data Isolation
- **Decision**: Separate channels and repositories per customer
- **Rationale**: Security, organization, compliance requirements
- **Architecture**: Multi-tenant with logical separation
- **Status**: Approved

#### ADR-004: Collaborative Development Infrastructure
- **Decision**: Implement shared file system for real-time collaboration
- **Options Evaluated**: NFS, SMB, peer-to-peer sync
- **Rationale**: Enable simultaneous work on documentation
- **Integration**: Git for version control, direct file system for editing
- **Status**: In Evaluation

#### ADR-005: Version Control Strategy
- **Decision**: Single main branch development
- **Rationale**: Simplicity for small team, avoid merge complexity
- **Tools**: Git with GitHub as central repository
- **Workflow**: Direct commits to main with immediate sync
- **Status**: Approved
