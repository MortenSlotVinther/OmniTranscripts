# OmniGaze: The Security Intelligence Orchestrator
## From Technical Threats to Business Impact - In Real Time

---

### **The Missing Link in Enterprise Security**

**Your Security Stack's Blind Spot:**
- **Siloed Tools**: 15+ security platforms that don't talk to each other
- **Technical Noise**: 10,000+ daily alerts with no business context
- **Impact Unknown**: Which threats actually affect critical business capabilities?
- **Board Disconnect**: Can't translate technical risks into business language
- **Response Paralysis**: No clear prioritization based on business impact

**The Revolutionary Approach: Security Intelligence Orchestration**
