## **1.3 Executive Summary**

We are pleased to present this **Architecture Requirements Specification (ARS)**, carefully tailored to **[Client]'s specific requirements** for implementing OmniGaze, **particularly its integration with [Client]'s ServiceNow Configuration Management Database** (CMDB). We have focused extensively on addressing [Client]'s key business drivers, including incident management, change management, cybersecurity, compliance, and strategic IT alignment, demonstrating our strong understanding of [Client]'s needs and objectives.

OmniGaze is positioned to significantly enhance [Client]'s IT service management capabilities through automated discovery and comprehensive visibility of IT assets spanning on-premise environments, virtual infrastructures, network devices, and cloud resources. By mapping critical dependencies between infrastructure components and applications, OmniGaze empowers [Client] to:

* **Reduce Mean Time to Resolution** (MTTR) for IT incidents by ensuring accurate and actionable dependency insights
* **Enhance change management** processes through precise identification of potential impacts from proposed changes
* **Strengthen cybersecurity** posture and achieve compliance with standards such as CIS18, aligning with [Client]'s security objectives
* **Optimize resource utilization** and reduce IT operational costs through improved transparency across IT assets
* **Support informed strategic decision-making** with comprehensive, real-time visibility into [Client]'s IT landscape

We have structured the implementation using a **phased approach**, clearly prioritized with the **MoSCoW method** (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have), reflecting [Client]'s immediate and long-term priorities. While initial efforts center on seamless integration with ServiceNow CMDB, the architecture thoughtfully accommodates **future expansions into** broader enterprise architecture initiatives, including **application portfolio management** and **business capability mapping**.

The insights presented in this ARS are enriched by **collaborative input** gathered during recent workshops, laying a robust **foundation for the forthcoming Architecture** Definition Document (ADD). We are proud to deliver this **comprehensive specification**, confident in our deep grasp of [Client]'s strategic and technical objectives.

## **1.4 Introduction**

The purpose of this document is to define the initial requirements for the OmniGaze implementation at [Client], focusing primarily on the integration with the ServiceNow CMDB. The project's overarching objective is to enhance [Client]'s IT service management practices by **automating asset discovery and dependency mapping**, ensuring that the ServiceNow CMDB remains accurate, up-to-date, and aligned with [Client]'s strategic goals.

The scope of this implementation includes the discovery, inventory, and mapping of on-premise IT assets, virtual machines, network devices, cloud resources, and network infrastructure components. Data gathered from these sources will be integrated into [Client]'s existing ServiceNow CMDB, ensuring that the platform becomes the central source of truth for IT operations.

The customer's primary business objectives, as we understand them, are to:

* **Modernize** their IT service management framework
* **Strengthen** their cybersecurity posture
* **Achieve compliance** with relevant regulations
* **Optimize** resource utilization and reduce IT operational costs

This document is intended for a broad audience, including business stakeholders, IT operations staff, security specialists, enterprise architects, and the implementation team for the OmniGaze solution.

The architecture requirements specified here will directly inform the subsequent **Architecture Definition Document (ADD)**, which will provide a detailed architectural blueprint for the solution.
