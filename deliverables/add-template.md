# **2\. Executive Summary**

This Architecture Definition Document (ADD) presents the technical blueprint for deploying the **OmniGaze platform at [Client]**, establishing a foundation for high-fidelity IT Asset Management (ITAM) and integrated enterprise architecture insights. The solution is designed to **transform [Client]'s hybrid infrastructure visibility**, enabling continuous discovery, intelligent dependency mapping, and seamless synchronization with the **ServiceNow Configuration Management Database** (CMDB).

At its core, the architecture builds on the **OmniGaze Core Platform**, which will be augmented with solution-specific components—or **Solution Building Blocks** (SBBs)—tailored to [Client]'s needs. These typically include:

* Integration with **cloud monitoring agents** for secure telemetry collection across cloud and on-premise systems
* A dedicated **ServiceNow integration layer** that transforms and exposes data in a ServiceNow-compatible format
* **SNMP-based network device inventory** capability targeting routers, switches, and firewalls
* **NetFlow/IPFIX processing module** for communication-based dependency detection beyond agent scope

The architecture is tightly aligned with [Client]'s strategic objectives. It enables **faster root cause analysis** through end-to-end dependency visibility, supporting the goal of reducing incident response time. By automating asset population into ServiceNow, it strengthens **change control processes** and reduces manual effort. OmniGaze's ability to surface stale or orphaned assets contributes to **resource optimization** and infrastructure hygiene, while its continuous discovery model reinforces **cybersecurity posture and compliance** with frameworks such as CIS18. Finally, the comprehensive view it provides serves as a **data-driven foundation** for executive planning and decision-making.

This document defines the target state architecture and supporting infrastructure that will bring these capabilities to life. The solution has been designed for operational resilience, high data quality, and tight alignment with [Client]'s security model, ensuring that it will not only deliver value at go-live but will also evolve with [Client]'s digital strategy.
