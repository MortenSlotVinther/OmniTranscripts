# OmniGaze Lead-to-Cash Pipeline: Implementation Bottleneck Analysis

## Executive Summary

Both the POC and implementation phases represent critical bottlenecks in OmniGaze's lead-to-cash pipeline. The POC phase requires actual coding and scanning to validate scenarios in new environments (expected for next 5-10 customers). A major emerging bottleneck is the Log Analytics feature being developed with GN - other customers now expect this unfinished feature in their POCs, creating impossible expectations. The implementation phase compounds these challenges with resource constraints - the CEO handles all software development roles while also managing partnerships, networking, and certifications. Additionally, existing paying customers (Wrist Ship Supply, Danske Fragtmænd, Stark) require ongoing support, re-onboarding, and feedback handling, further straining resources.

## ROI Analysis of Solutions

| Solution | Investment | Time Saved | ROI Period | Priority |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------|----------|
| Local LLM Setup | $30K | 10x POC speed | 2 weeks | CRITICAL |
| QA Environment | $50K | Reduce POC releases from 20-30 to 5 | 1 month | CRITICAL |
| CI/CD Pipeline | $30K | 40% efficiency | 2 months | HIGH |
| 2 Senior Devs | $400K/year | CEO time freed | 6 months | CRITICAL |
| Partner Activation | $50K | Leverage existing training investment | Immediate | HIGH |

## Success Metrics

### Implementation Phase KPIs
- POC releases: Target < 5 (current: 20-30)
- POC duration with coding: Target 4 weeks (current: 4+ weeks with delays)
- Feature bleeding incidents: Target 0 (current: Log Analytics + others)
- Security clearance time: Target during sales (current: during POC)
- CEO POC involvement: Target < 20% (current: 100%)
- Partner POC delivery: Target 50% (current: 0%)
- Implementation time: Target < 8 weeks (current: 12-16 weeks)

### Quarterly Targets
- Q1 2025: QA environment operational, 2 developers hired
- Q2 2025: CI/CD fully implemented, first partner trained
- Q3 2025: 3 successful partner implementations
- Q4 2025: Average implementation time < 8 weeks

## Risk Mitigation

### Critical Risks
1. **CEO Burnout**: Handling all dev roles + partnerships + networking - unsustainable
   - Mitigation: Local LLM to augment all roles + immediate developer hiring

2. **Feature Bleeding Crisis**: Log Analytics being built for GN but expected by all
   - Impact: Every new POC expects unfinished features from other customers
   - Mitigation: Clear feature roadmap communication + "coming soon" messaging

3. **POC Gift Basket Syndrome**: Customers expect 20-30 releases and extra features
   - Mitigation: Clear POC boundaries + leverage partner consultants

4. **Existing Customer Drain**: Wrist, DF, Stark requiring ongoing support
   - Mitigation: Dedicated support team separate from development

5. **Scaling Inability**: Cannot grow with CEO as sole developer
   - Mitigation: Accept 3-4 month onboarding, focus on enterprise skills

## Conclusion

Both POC and implementation phases are bottlenecked by resource constraints and technical limitations. The Log Analytics feature bleeding from GN to other customer POCs exemplifies how product development and POC expectations have become dangerously intertwined. The CEO is overwhelmed handling all software development roles while managing partnerships, certifications, and networking. The inability to use cloud AI for sensitive EA data and lack of local LLM setup creates severe productivity penalties. Immediate action on local LLM deployment, QA environment setup, clear feature roadmap communication, and accepting the 3-4 month developer onboarding timeline is critical. The recommended solutions provide a path to sustainable operations within 12 months.
