## Common Objections & Responses

### "We already have discovery tools"
**Response**: "Many organizations use multiple discovery tools but still struggle with data accuracy and integration. OmniGaze uniquely combines discovery with intelligent dependency mapping and seamless ServiceNow integration. Could we explore your current gaps?"

### "We don't have budget allocated"
**Response**: "I understand budget timing is important. Many of our customers start with a proof of concept to demonstrate ROI before budget allocation. The POC investment is fully credited toward the full implementation. Would it make sense to explore what value we could demonstrate?"

### "We're too busy with other projects"
**Response**: "That's exactly why automated discovery is valuable - it reduces the manual effort required for asset management. Our POC can run alongside your current projects with minimal resource impact. Could we discuss a timeline that works for you?"
