### Challenge: Data quality issues discovered
**Solution**: Document current state, show improvement potential, include remediation in project scope

### Challenge: Performance issues
**Solution**: Analyze root cause, tune configuration, document infrastructure requirements

### Challenge: Stakeholder availability
**Solution**: Record demonstrations, provide async review options, schedule multiple shorter sessions

## POC Best Practices
1. **Daily communication** - Short check-ins prevent surprises
2. **Document everything** - Screenshots, metrics, issues
3. **Show quick wins** - Demonstrate value in week 1
4. **Engage stakeholders** - Regular demonstrations
5. **Address concerns immediately** - Don't wait until the end
6. **Focus on customer success criteria** - Not generic demos
7. **Leave environment clean** - Professional handover
