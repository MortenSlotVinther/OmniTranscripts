## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Multiple stakeholders with conflicting priorities
**Solution**: Facilitate priority alignment workshop, focus on shared objectives

### Challenge: Incomplete technical information
**Solution**: Schedule technical deep-dive session, request architecture documentation

### Challenge: Unclear success criteria
**Solution**: Use SMART goal framework, provide example metrics from similar customers

## Tools and Resources
