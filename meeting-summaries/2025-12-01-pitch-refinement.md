# Meeting Summary: Pitch Deck Refinement Session
**Date:** December 1, 2025
**Participants:** Morten Vinther, John Fabienke, Sofie Levi Pourhadi
**Topic:** Series A Pitch Deck Review and Refinement

## Executive Summary
The team conducted a detailed review of the Series A pitch deck, identifying key areas for improvement to better resonate with investors. Main focus areas included simplifying messaging, removing confusing metaphors, clarifying timelines, and positioning OmniGaze more clearly in the competitive landscape.

## Key Decisions and Changes

### 1. Title and Positioning
- **Change:** Replace "From Code to Company" with **"Building the Operating System for Enterprises"**
- **Remove:** "Not Snippets. Transformation" - investors don't understand this distinction
- **Rationale:** Need clearer, more professional positioning that immediately conveys value

### 2. Product Naming Consistency
- **Decision:** Use "OmniGaze" consistently throughout
- **Remove:** References to "OmniGaze Infrastructure" or "Harmonoid" as separate entities
- **Clarification:** OmniGaze and Harmonoid AI are ONE integrated product

### 3. Competitive Positioning

#### Remove Negative References
- **Delete:** "Cursor builds code. We build companies."
- **Principle:** No slogans that disparage other companies
- **Alternative:** Focus on our unique value without mentioning competitors negatively

#### Add Palantir Comparison
- **New Slide:** Create comparison showing:
  - Palantir: Security/Military surveillance
  - OmniGaze: Enterprise IT transformation
- **Message:** "We're the Palantir for enterprise IT"

#### Ecosystem Approach
- **New Slide:** Show partnership/ecosystem strategy
- **Position:** We integrate with and enhance existing tools (Datadog, Dynatrace, ServiceNow)
- **Message:** "We don't replace, we orchestrate"

### 4. Timeline and Claims Corrections

#### Engineering Miracle Slide
- **Remove:** "2 years" and "21 active installations"
- **Clarify:** 
  - Foundation developed over 8+ years
  - Commercial operations for ~2 years
  - AI acceleration started 1 year ago
  - 400,000 lines of code accumulated over time

#### Development Timeline
- **Add:** "AI-first techniques accelerate us 30x"
- **Context:** Clarify that AI development acceleration is recent (last year)

### 5. NOW vs FUTURE Capabilities

#### Current Capabilities (NOW)
- Foundation layer
- Asset discovery
- Dependency mapping
- Compliance automation
- Operational savings

#### Future Vision (NEED FUNDING FOR)
- AI transformation layer
- Code generation for enterprises
- Business capability automation
- Full enterprise transformation

### 6. Visual and Metaphor Changes

#### Remove Confusing Metaphors
- **Delete:** Chicken and egg analogy
- **Reason:** Too confusing for investors

#### Consistent Visualization
- **Use:** Iceberg diagram throughout
  - Top 10%: What competitors do (code generation)
  - Bottom 90%: OmniGaze foundation (infrastructure, integration, observability)
- **Alternative:** Pyramid diagram showing layers
- **Technique:** Use arrows to point to specific layers when discussing features

### 7. Customer Proof Points
- **Add:** Security and compliance as key decision factors
- **Emphasize:** Wrist chose us "for compliance and security purposes"
- **Context:** Position as enterprise-grade, trusted solution

### 8. Market Sizing
- **Add:** Credible sources (IDC, Gartner, McKinsey)
- **Clarify:** Cursor/Lovable reached $100M ARR "within months" with simple LLM overlays
- **Message:** We provide the infrastructure they can't build

### 9. Slogan Refinements
- **Remove:** All negative comparisons
- **Keep:** Positive, bold statements like "Infrastructure wins wars"
- **Add:** "Building the Operating System for Enterprises"

### 10. Specific Slide Changes

#### Slide 2 (Market)
- Add timeline: "within months" for Cursor/Lovable growth
- Clarify: "thin shell on top of LLMs" instead of "simple overlays"

#### Slide 4 (Traction)
- Remove: Revenue per employee comparisons
- Add: Compliance and security context
- Focus: Three-year contracts, proven ROI

#### Slide 5 (Engineering)
- Clarify: Development timeline (8+ years foundation, 1 year AI acceleration)
- Remove: "Zero critical failures across all deployments" (snapshot metric)
- Keep: 400,000 lines of production code

## Action Items
1. Create new Palantir comparison slide
2. Develop ecosystem/partnership visualization
3. Separate NOW vs FUTURE capabilities clearly
4. Update all slides with consistent "OmniGaze" naming
5. Remove all negative competitor references
6. Add credible market sources
7. Create consistent iceberg/pyramid visualizations

## Key Insights
- Investors need simpler, clearer messaging
- Avoid technical jargon and complex metaphors
- Focus on proven traction and clear differentiation
- Position as infrastructure enabler, not competitor
- Emphasize security and compliance as differentiators

## Next Steps
- Revise pitch deck with all changes
- Create visual prompts for design team
- Review with advisors for final feedback
- Prepare for investor meetings with refined narrative
