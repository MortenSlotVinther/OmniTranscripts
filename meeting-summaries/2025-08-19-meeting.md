## Key Strategic Decisions

### 3. Customer Information Management
- **Decision**: Create dedicated Teams channels per customer
- **Structure**:
  - One Teams channel per customer engagement
  - All customer-related documents and transcripts organized by channel
  - Markdown-based knowledge base per customer
  - Integration with Confluence or SharePoint for storage

### 4. Tool Philosophy
- **Preference**: Move away from Microsoft-centric tools where possible
